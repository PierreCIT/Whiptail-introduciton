It is a mini project made in bash and whiptail to experiment with interfaces in a shell environment.


## What does it do ?

Almost nothing really. It is just a test interface. The only real actions it can do are :
 * Create a directory (from the current folder). And print an error in case of failure.
 * Show the list of files in the current directory.

**Note :** The progress bar only displays information but doesn't do anything really.
